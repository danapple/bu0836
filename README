I will be happy to have my changes integrated into drehscheibe/bu0836.

Get sources:
------------

  $ git clone https://github.com/danapple0/bu0836.git



Update sources:
---------------

  $ cd bu0836/
  $ git pull



Build:
------

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

    or:

  $ cmake .
  $ make -f Makefile
  $ sudo make -f Makefile install



Dependencies:
-------------

  libusb-1.0 + devel



Run:                                   ===  I M P O R T A N T ! ===

Before you write changes to your controller use the --save option to save the
original EEPROM contents to a file. That way you can in the worst case restore
it. Never play with the --load option. Only use it if you've run into problems
and don't see another way to solve them. (You may want to search for WARRANTY
in the COPYING file.  :-)

   $ bu0836 --save=my_eeprom
   $ chmod 444 my_eeprom






For pretty-printing of the man page make sure you have the pstools installed,
and do this:

  $ man -t bu0836|psbook|psnup -2|psselect -o|lpr
  ### turn paper stack
  $ man -t bu0836|psbook|psnup -2|psselect -e -r|lpr

or this to get it as pdf file:

  $ make pdf



Remarks:

- The application includes its own option parser instead of using getopt as
  this seemed easier to port to other systems. It works pretty much like
  what you are used to, though.

- A (still just rudimentary) HID parser is included because this is necessary
  for interpreting the device's joystick data output. One could just look at
  the respective bytes of the HID report instead, but then the slightest change
  in the firmware could break this application. The reason why all the description
  strings are included is that it's supposed to be a generic HID parser, not
  one tailored for bu0836. This might be changed later -- in either direction:
  dropping all those strings, or adding even more of them.  :-)
